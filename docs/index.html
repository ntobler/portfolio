                Rocket Lab is an aerospace manufacturer and small satellite launch service provider.
                To obtain a launch license from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the Flight Analysis team at Rocket Lab develops in-house tools to demonstrate that the risk of potential debris from a launch vehicle is below the required threshold.
                The developed tool calculates high-resolution debris maps from Monte Carlo simulations of the launch vehicle trajectory to comply with the updated FAA requirements of <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-III/subchapter-C/part-450" target="_blank">14 CFR Part 450</a>.
                The tool programmed in Python with performance critical parts in C++ is integrated into the existing pipeline-based software architecture.

            <p>
                Astro photography requires long exposure times to capture faint objects in the night sky.
                To compensate for the star movement during the exposure, the camera can be rotated about the Earth's axis using a star tracker.
                On the northern hemisphere, the North Star (Polaris) can be used to precisely align the star tracker using an optical viewfinder.
                However, on the southern hemisphere, a more sophisticated approach is required, as the South Celestial Pole lacks a bright reference star.
            </p>
            <p>
                A solution using a low-noise IMX462 camera module together with a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W has been engineered to estimate the attitude of the star tracker's alignment axis from a camera image.
                A web application accessible through the Raspberry Pi's WiFi functionality has been developed to visualize the alignment in real-time.
                After pre-processing the raw image, the star positions and the resulting attitude is calculated using an <a href="https://github.com/ntobler/ruststartracker">algorithm</a> proposed by <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/citations/20200001376">Pedrotty et al., 2020</a> implemented in Rust and Python.
                The tool requires only coarse initial camera calibration data, as high-confidence measurements can be used to refine the calibration parameters.
                Furthermore, mechanical misalignment of the camera and the star tracker can be compensated for by using a simple calibration procedure.
            </p>
            <p>
                With the hardware setup used, the algorithm is able to detect the attitude from star positions in a single image with a one-sigma precision of less than 0.01°.
                The absolute accuracy has not been quantified, however, field tests have shown that the alignment is accurate enough for multiple minute exposures without visible residual star movement.

            <p>
                Coil springs must be measured accurately during production to ensure quality standards.
                However, most geometries are very complex and are prone to deformation even with very little force applied.
                While current measuring methods can only provide limited information about the true geometry,
                commercially available 3D scanners are expensive and only provide incomplete output geometry.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the course of this project, an alternative 3D scanning approach using cameras with non-orthographic optics has been developed and tested.
                Multiple calibrated cameras are used to simultaneously record images of a coil spring from different perspectives.
                Parameters of a high-dimensional mathematical model are then fitted to footage to yield a complete 3D wire path model of the spring.
                Furthermore, artificial intelligence accelerator hardware enables parallel stochastic optimization of the coil spring model parameters,
                which reduces computation time drastically and increases accuracy.
            </p>
            <p>
                The functionality of the new measurement method has been successfully validated on demonstrator hardware.
                The object under test is placed on a backlit glass surface where it is captured by cameras and measured within seconds.
                A repeatable accuracy in the sub-millimeter range is achieved over a broad band of spring types and sizes.
                The measurements are repeatable and consistent over different rotations and translations on the measurement plate.
                The project is being pursued by Spühl GmbH for industrialization, where a prototype is in production.

            <p>
                Backcountry skiing and snowshoe hiking are popular winter sports that involve the risk of avalanches.
                Avalanche transceivers are often used as a fast and reliable tool to locate buried victims.
                A quick and accurate localization of the victim is crucial to increase the chance of survival, which declines rapidly after a few minutes.
                The device carried by the victim operates as a sender, whereas the device of the rescuer is in receiving mode.
                Every second, a 457kHz radio pulse is emitted which is sensed by the receiver device.
                Current solutions guide the rescuer to follow the magnetic field lines toward the sender, which is an indirect and time-consuming path.
                Once the rescuer is close to the receiver, a sequence of predefined motions needs to be performed to precisely pinpoint the sender device.
            </p>
            <p>
                This thesis suggests faster and more accurate localization techniques utilizing statistical signal processing algorithms.
                Our work introduces two algorithms using extended Kalman filters that differ from the type of used sensors.
                The physical model of the magnetic field is embodied in the filter to estimate the location and attitude of the sender relative to the receiver device.
                A first simplified algorithm relies on positional data, which is difficult to obtain on a low-power handheld device.
                The second algorithm relies only on already available sensor measurements of the Mammut Barryvox avalanche transceiver device.
                Both proposed algorithms have been tested extensively in a Monte Carlo simulation environment.
                The environment simulates the emitted magnetic field, randomized rescuer movement patterns, sensor inaccuracies, and noise levels.
                Furthermore, a functioning hardware demonstrator has been built to test the algorithms in the field using live data from the Barryvox device.
                The algorithms running on a desktop computer gather sensor data wirelessly from the hardware demonstrator.
                The instruction outputs are then transmitted to a graphical interface for the rescuer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Both proposed algorithms perform extremely well in the simulation environment.
                The sender position estimate gets progressively more accurate during the search phase and omits the need for a pinpoint phase altogether.
                In the simulated environment, the hardware-adapted algorithm is able to accurately locate the victim within 0.3m horizontal distance median or 0.6m distance in 90% of all simulation runs.
                This accuracy is achieved in fewer than 70 simulated seconds.
                The hardware demonstrator is able to confirm these results, with only a slight reduction of accuracy.
                When following only the instructions on the graphical interface, test subjects have been able to locate the sender in 9 of 10 cases with a mean horizontal distance of 0.6m.

                <i>Solidago gigantea</i> is an invasive neophyte and a major threat to biodiversity.
                Our newly developed AI algorithms make it possible to detect <i>Solidago gigantea</i> coverage from simple RGB aerial drone imagery alone.
                As drone imagery becomes increasingly ubiquitous, techniques such as the proposed algorithms enable fast, cheap and accurate neophyte detection.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our algorithms, trained with <i>Solidago</i> coverage labels, are able to process orthomosaic images and output a coverage map.
                The software is generic and hence can include additional layers, such as multispectral imagery and/or digital surface models, leading to even better results.
                In this work, several algorithms have been developed, including a custom deep convolutional neural network and an innovative semi-supervised clustering approach.
                The custom deep convolutional neural network is a fully convolutional architecture that gives a probability distribution output per pixel.
                As labels are often rare, the semi-supervised approach extracts features from superpixels and clusters them in an unsupervised fashion.
                The labels are only used to determine which unsupervised class belongs to which predefined class.
            </p>
            <p>
                These results have been achieved on a single image from the Entensee in Kaltbrunn, Switzerland where <i>Solidago gigantea</i> is common.
                To generalize these results, aerial data and <i>Solidago gigantea</i> labels have been found for the whole canton of Zürich.
                Unfortunately, negative labels are not available, so the algorithms could not be applied.
                To solve this problem, new one-class <i>Solidago</i> detection algorithms have been developed.
            </p>
            <p>
                The results, although preliminary, clearly indicate the high effectiveness of the proposed solutions for identifying <i>Solidago gigantea</i> coverage.
                Since the algorithms perform well with RGB data alone, numerous potential applications using crowd-sourced data may emerge, utilizing variants of the proposed schemes.
